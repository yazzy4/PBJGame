# PbjGame

When I was in the 5th grade, I had a teacher who did this exercise that is embedded in me. How do you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? I think about this daily, especially when I sit down to code. Creating an app seems simple enough - I want this thing to do that thing, so I'm gonna make this thing do that thing and its done. 


What I remember most about this lesson is how so many of my fellow classmates tried and failed. I remember seeing the smartest kids fail and be baffled by that. I remember failing myself, but what I won't ever forget is the one person that succeeded. He was a kid who no one took seriously, a class clown or a bully. I remember how the class laughed as he gave detailed precise step after step of the correct logic. When he made a pbj the class was silent.

How hard could it be to make a PBJ? Apparently, pretty hard. 

I had no way in knowing that this is the moment that inspired me to want to code. I am building this project so other people might find that magic as well.
